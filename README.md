# e-plantShopping

This repo is called **e-plantShopping**.

I built this as a small React practice project (shopping cart + plant list). The main stuff it does:

- show a list of plants
- add/remove items in the cart
- change quantities and keep totals updated

## How to run it

You’ll need Node.js installed.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes (what I used)

- React + Vite
- Redux Toolkit / React Redux
